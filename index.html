          <span
            >Description: Born during a storm on Dragonstone, Daenerys is the
            last surviving Targaryen princess (or so she believes). She was
            exiled to Essos as a child and was later married off to Khal Drogo
            to secure political alliances. Over time, she grows into a powerful
            leader, freeing slaves in the cities of Slaver’s Bay and forming a
            strong army known as the Unsullied. She is the mother of three
            dragons—Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion—who play a significant role in
            her quest to reclaim the Iron Throne. Her journey is one of
            transformation, from a timid girl to a fierce ruler with a vision of
            breaking the wheel of oppression in Westeros.</span

          <span
            >Description: Raised as the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark, Jon
            Snow was always an outsider in Winterfell. Seeking purpose, he joins
            the Night’s Watch, where he proves himself as a natural leader. Over
            time, Jon discovers his true parentage—he is the son of Rhaegar
            Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him the rightful heir to the Iron
            Throne. He is known for his deep sense of honor, bravery in battle,
            and willingness to unite opposing factions, including the Wildlings
            and Night’s Watch, to fight against the White Walkers. His
            resurrection by Melisandre after being betrayed by his own men
            further cements his destiny as a pivotal figure in the fate of
            Westeros.</span

            >Description: Gregor Clegane is one of the most feared warriors in
            Westeros, known for his immense size, brutal strength, and cruelty.
            He serves House Lannister as a ruthless enforcer, carrying out some
            of the most horrific acts in the series, including the rape and
            murder of Elia Martell and her children. After being fatally wounded
            by Oberyn Martell in a trial by combat, he is resurrected by Qyburn
            through dark and unnatural means, turning him into an almost
            mindless, zombie-like killing machine. Now serving as Cersei
            Lannister’s personal bodyguard, The Mountain is a silent yet
            terrifying presence, ready to crush anyone who threatens his
            queen.</span

          <span
            >Description: A former maester stripped of his title due to his
            unethical experiments, Qyburn becomes one of Cersei Lannister’s
            closest advisors. He is intelligent, cunning, and willing to delve
            into forbidden sciences, including necromancy, to serve his queen.
            His most infamous creation is the zombified version of The Mountain,
            whom he resurrects to be Cersei’s personal bodyguard. Rising through
            the ranks, Qyburn eventually replaces Pycelle as the Hand of the
            Queen, playing a crucial role in Cersei’s rule and her schemes to
            maintain power.</span

            >Description: Tywin Lannister is the ruthless and highly intelligent
            patriarch of House Lannister. He is a master strategist, serving as
            Hand of the King to multiple rulers, including King Aerys II, King
            Joffrey, and King Tommen. Tywin is known for his cold and calculated
            leadership, willing to do whatever it takes to maintain Lannister
            dominance. Despite being feared and respected, he has a complicated
            relationship with his children, especially Tyrion, whom he despises
            for being a dwarf and for allegedly causing his wife’s death during
            childbirth. His ultimate downfall comes at the hands of Tyrion, who
            kills him in one of the most shocking moments of the series.</span

            >Description: Jaime Lannister is one of the most skilled swordsmen
            in Westeros, known for his good looks, charm, and arrogance. He
            earned the infamous title “Kingslayer” after betraying and killing
            King Aerys II during Robert’s Rebellion, an act seen as dishonorable
            despite his noble intentions of preventing mass destruction. He
            shares an incestuous relationship with his twin sister, Cersei, and
            is deeply loyal to his family. Over the series, Jaime undergoes one
            of the most complex character arcs, transforming from a selfish,
            arrogant knight into a more self-aware and conflicted man,
            especially after losing his sword hand and forming an unexpected
            bond with Brienne of Tarth.</span

            >Description: Joffrey Baratheon is one of the most despised
            characters in the series, known for his cruelty, sadism, and
            unpredictable nature. Though he is officially the son of King Robert
            Baratheon, he is actually the product of Cersei and Jaime
            Lannister’s incestuous relationship. Raised as the heir to the
            throne, Joffrey becomes king after Robert’s death and quickly
            establishes himself as a tyrant. His actions include ordering the
            execution of Ned Stark, torturing Sansa Stark, and abusing his power
            to instill fear in those around him. His reign is cut short when he
            is poisoned at his own wedding, an event orchestrated by Lady Olenna
            Tyrell and Petyr Baelish.</span
